### In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in 
### Python that prompts the user for input and then
### outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation
### and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
### Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt 
### the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your
### own as an argument to input.

# take input and change case
x = input("Provide a sentence for transformation ").lower()

# print result
print(x)
